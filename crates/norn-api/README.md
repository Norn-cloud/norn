# Core wire contracts

Projects the Rust IR and checker schemas into OpenAPI components for the TypeScript SDK.
Run `norn openapi` to regenerate the contract. Cell execution uses `norn-cell` and
`norn-kernel` directly; this crate supplies no server.

The replay clock is a host prerequisite: the pure `Clock` interface supplies
kernel logical time, and `ManualClock` supports deterministic replay through
shared `Arc` handles. Wall-clock access, the native server, connector host and
analytics executor remain deferred to subsequent ports.

## Host export contract (slice 1a)

Exports scope and refusal infrastructure without a server or store.
Transport adapters map `Refusal.status` to their response.

- HOST-SCOPE: missing/blank dimensions refuse with `scope.missing` (400);
  exact dimension mismatches refuse with `scope.denied` (403).
  Keys percent-escape `%` and `/` once per component.
- HOST-WIRE: camelCase scopes, snake_case categories, status outside JSON.
- HOST-REFUSAL: conceal opaque diagnostics while retaining code/category/status;
  explicit categories override status defaults. Commit projection follows later.
- HOST-IDENTITY: visibility uses canonical `norn_ir::ScopeRef`.

Correspondence: `tests/host_perimeter.rs`. Denial-before-read and default-deny
belong to host wiring; the perimeter performs no IO.

## Host target and base contracts

HOST-TARGET: native targets enable the native cell adapter; Wasm uses the portable
cell implementation. Default library builds and the fixture command need no flags.
HOST-BASE: admission accepts a complete standalone tenant artifact set with no
external base catalog. Extensions requiring a separate trusted base refuse; the
host never infers base authority from submitted definitions.

## Host admission epoch (slice 1b)

HOST-ADMISSION: `DevHost::new` checks a full source array before initializing a
fresh tenant store: unrelated residual schema/state refuses. An identical
initial provisioning request reopens without writing.
Only a successful transactional definition install publishes
the host. Trusted installs check before taking the exclusive definition epoch;
failed admission and stale-version installs preserve both revision and ledger.
Readers hold the shared epoch through authorization, store load and projection.
HOST-EXACT: retained source uses the existing RuntimeValue path, and the checker
issues its receipt unchanged. HOST-RECEIPT is **not claimed**: #290/#273 track the
checker identity gap. No additional host canonicalizer is introduced.
HOST-IDENTITY: artifacts, scope and logical time remain the canonical IR/kernel
types. The API now owns a ring-1 host over ring-1 cells; pure contracts stay here.
Correspondence: `host::tests`. HTTP reads and action parity follow in later slices.


HOST-PROVISION-ATOMIC: initialization, scope binding, initial definitions, model
snapshot, receipt and ledger publish in one engine transaction. Failure or abrupt
process loss before commit leaves no application schema; after commit a lost
reply leaves the complete initial revision. An identical provisioning request
(scope, projected model and full install input, including logical time) reopens
the current revision without writes, including after later trusted installs; a
changed provisioning request refuses. Residual unrelated schema is never adopted. The transaction owns the
freshness check, so competing requests cannot both initialize the cell.
Correspondence: `definitions_install::host_provision_atomic_at_every_storage_boundary`
injects errors and abrupt subprocess exit after every SQL operation, before
commit and after commit, then reopens, retries and checks conflicting retries.
